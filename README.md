# parachute-rescue
This simple game was initially created in Java/Processing, and then converted to C, to be played on an arduino with four switches. 

In this game, the player needs to rescue parachuters with landing pads.

## Instructions
- Use keyboard buttons `1`, `2`, `3` and `4` to activate/deactivate the landings pads (the four brown rectangles at the bottom of the screen).
- You receive one point for each parachuter who reaches the ground.
- Green parachuters are **good guys**, and red parachuters are **bad guys**.
- You lose one HP if a **good guy** reaches the ground without landing on a landing pad.
- You lose one HP if a **bad guy** reaches the ground and lands on a landing pad. 
- Once your HP reaches zero, you have lost the game.
