# parachute-rescue
This simple game was initially created in Java/Processing, and then converted to C (not present in this repostiory), to be played on an arduino with four switches. 

In this game, the player needs to rescue parachuters with landing pads.

## Arduino Video 

Below is a video which shows how the pads were activated/deactivated on the arduino. The arduino model is [chipKIT Basic IO Shield](https://digilent.com/reference/chipkit_shield_basic_io_shield/refmanual).
